            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:40306:5"/> human Converſation to the Principles of natural Religion, do's not ſeem to be ſo very deſperate, as ſome Men of narrow Sentiments are pleaſed to make it; and it ſeems to me that <hi>St. Paul</hi> was of this mind, when he ſaid, That <hi>when the Gentiles which have not the Law, do by nature the things contained in the Law, theſe having not the Law are a Law unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which ſhew the work of the Law written in their Hearts, their Conſcience alſo bearing witneſs, and their Thoughts the mean while ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing or elſe excuſing one another.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:40306:5"/> if it prove Succeſsful, to pry within this aged and venerable <hi>Vail,</hi> and look through the <hi>Symbol</hi> and <hi>Hieroglyphic</hi> Emblem, into the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> and the <hi>Truth</hi> of Things; the effect of which Enquiry will be this, that it will appear that even the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi> themſelves, thoſe I mean, that contrived and molded their Religion; the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Poets,</hi> and <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi> of the <hi>Heathen</hi> World, had a juſt and true Notion of the divine Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and of the way and means by which his Nature ſhould be worſhip'd and his Anger appeas'd, as appears by their <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> their <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations,</hi> which were all or moſt of them <hi>Symbolical Adumbrations</hi> of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Obligations we have contracted to him, of the Cleanneſs, Purity, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Integrity, which he expects in his Worſhip and in the Conduct of our Lives, and of that awful Humility, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Submiſſion, and moſt unfeigned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<pb facs="tcp:40306:6"/> with which we ought to be acted and affected, when we look back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward upon our Sins and Follies, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards upon his pure, unſpotted and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted Nature, which <hi>is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity,</hi> and cannot converſe with unrepenting Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, continuing in a State of <hi>Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi> and <hi>Obduration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is at once a pleaſant and a profitable Contemplation, when we converſe either with <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Sages, or with the <hi>Mytho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins,</hi> which was borrowed from them in a great meaſure at leaſt, to think how the Principles of Vertue and good Life, as in the <hi>Symbols</hi> of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and in many of the <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Myſteries</hi> of the <hi>Gentil</hi> Worſhip, notwithſtanding the Heat of the reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Climates, were muffled and folded up in multiplicity of Garments, and in ſo great variety of Shadows and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guizes; and yet through all theſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings by their own native Brightneſs,
<pb facs="tcp:40306:6"/> they ſhould compel and force their Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage into the Eyes and Heart of every competent Enquirer, and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſtill more glorious, more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and attractive, more beautiful and bright, for being thus induſtriouſly darkned and concealed.</p>
            <p>If Antiquity with too profuſe a Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, exalted good Men, or Men that were uſeful and ſerviceable to their Country by great Benefactions, or by the invention of profitable Arts, into the Rank and Dignity of <hi>Gods,</hi> and paid them a Worſhip ſuitable to that Opinion, yet this hinders not but we may reap advantage, even from the Superſtition and Ignorance of our blind Forefathers, and though we do not adore them as <hi>Divinities;</hi> yet we may bleſs their Memories, and pay that Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which is juſtly due to the Aſhes of <hi>Heroes</hi> and <hi>Illuſtrious</hi> Perſons, and we may lay them before us, as Copies and Examples to imitate and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
<pb facs="tcp:40306:7"/> as far as we are able, and as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as opportunity preſents it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Neither would the Antients have been ſo much to blame, that they divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and parcel'd the <hi>Omnipreſent Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> into ſo great variety of Names and Notions, according to the ſeveral relations and reſpects which that <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipreſence</hi> bears to ſeveral and diſtant parts of the Creation, as that in the <hi>Heavens</hi> they called him <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Minerva, Ceres</hi> and <hi>Ops</hi> upon the ſurface of the <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>underneath</hi> it, <hi>Pluto</hi> and <hi>Proſerpina,</hi> in the Sea <hi>Neptune,</hi> upon the Shore <hi>Priapus,</hi> and in the Port <hi>Portunus</hi> and <hi>Palaemon,</hi> but that it gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the <hi>Vulgar</hi> ſort, who could not diſcern the <hi>Philoſophy</hi> of theſe things to look upon them, becauſe of their ſeveral <hi>Names,</hi> and of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> uſed in their Worſhip, as ſo many <hi>diſtinct</hi> and <hi>independent</hi> Beings, to <hi>each</hi> of which

            <p>That which I now preſent your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with, is but one Part in <hi>four</hi> of that which I deſign; the next will be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat <hi>Diatriba</hi> by it ſelf of the <hi>Perſian, Aegyptian, Aſſyrian,</hi> and <hi>Chaldean</hi> Deities, which with a great deal more, is now already finiſh'd from my hands, and ſhall very ſoon be publiſh'd to the World, if this which I now put abroad ſhall meet with that Encouragement and Acceptance which I hope it will; and the reaſon why I broke off here, was only, that not intending any ſuch thing at firſt, but only to write a Sheet or two by way of Notes upon the former Treatiſe; I had not affixt the Numbers upon the top of the Pages, which I fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw would create diſorder and confuſion to my Reader, and beſides, it look'd ridiculous to call that Notes upon a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

            <p>I hope without Vanity, I may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have made much greater Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries than any Man in this kind hath done before me, and ſome of them I would by no means exchange or part with, or loſe the juſt Glory of having found them out, to be thought or to have been the Author of the beſt Book that ever I read in my life; and if any Man ſhall ask why at every turn I am thus importunate and troubleſom to your Lordſhip?

Neither was this all, but the Husband was an abſolute Lord over his Wife, and the Wife was in the nature of a Servant to her Husband) The dominion of Husbands over their Wives by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Laws of <hi>Rome,</hi> which in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular were Copied from the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> is thus

And then it follows as another great inſtance of this Arbitrary power of Husbands over their Wives, that if the Husband had committed Adultery, which is the higheſt violation of conjugal Duty, he could not be toucht, but if the Wife were guilty of the ſame, it was in the Husbands power to kill her with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity with his own hands, and without ſo much as bringing her to a Tryal, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that he caught her in the very Fact, for which his word muſt in this caſe be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.

            <p>Fourthly as it is now plain, why ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny writers after one another, being led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the miſtake of the Firſt whom they followed, have placed <hi>Ogyges</hi> in the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo it is no leſs plain why they

            <p>Fifthly, If we lay both theſe <hi>Graecian</hi> Traditions together, that <hi>Ogyges</hi> lived in the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and that he Reigned over <hi>Attica</hi> in that Age, the latter of which miſtakes I have now diſcovered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what reaſon it depended, and the firſt as I have ſaid, (that is, that which I have mentioned firſt, for it is the latter in order of time) is owing to this that there is ſuch a perſon as <hi>Agag</hi> or <hi>Ogyges</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Moſaick</hi> writings, I ſay, if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare theſe things together, they will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
<pb facs="tcp:40306:27" rendition="simple:additions"/> betray and expoſe one another, for it is ridiculous to think that <hi>Balaam</hi> refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to any ſuch King of <hi>Attica,</hi> a place with which neither <hi>Balack</hi> nor the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> had at that time any Correſpondence, much leſs was he ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>amous and well known among them, that the King of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> who was to come many Ages after, ſhould be Proverbially compared to him, and that it ſhould be ſaid of him, that <hi>he ſhould be higher then</hi> Agag, and that <hi>his Kingdom ſhould be exalted,</hi> as if <hi>Attica,</hi> a ſmall and inconſiderable ſpot of Ground, had been ſome vaſt and Formidable Empire; nay, I dare vouch for moſt, if not all the <hi>Jews</hi> now living, or that have lived ever ſince this Story was firſt broached, that they are and have been ignorant, of any ſuch <hi>Athenian</hi> King, and ſo at this rate this Prophecy would not have been only obſcure and unintelligible when it was firſt uttered, but would remain to this day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the number of thoſe difficulties, that are to be explained at the coming of <hi>Elias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be urged that <hi>Balaam</hi> in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy referred to <hi>Agag</hi> the King of the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> who was afterwards Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Saul,</hi> I anſwer, that I do believe <hi>Balaam</hi> in part to have referred to this,
<pb facs="tcp:40306:28" rendition="simple:additions"/> for <hi>Agag</hi> was a Succeſſor, though at a great diſtance, of <hi>Balack,</hi> and Ruled over the ſame Country that the other did, and it was in requital of the injuries done by <hi>Balak,</hi> that this overthrow fell upon the <hi>Amalekites</hi> in the days of <hi>Saul,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 2, 3, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that which</hi> Amalek <hi>did to</hi> Iſrael, <hi>how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from</hi> Aegypt; <hi>now go, and ſmite</hi> Amalek, <hi>and utterly deſtroy all that they have, and ſpare them not, but ſlay both Man and Woman, Infant and Suckling, Ox and Sheep, Camel and Aſs.</hi> But yet I ſay, that this, though it was a partial fulfilling of this Proyhecy, yet it is not all that proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity and increaſe of honour and power, which is ſhadowed out under it, Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Agag</hi> in compariſon, was but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable Prince, and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> when they came out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> though nothing ſo ſtrong as in the time of <hi>Saul,</hi> were more then a match for the <hi>Moabites</hi> and <hi>Amalekites,</hi> at that time, wherefore it is ſaid, Num. 22. v. 3, 4, 5. that, Moab <hi>was ſore afraid of the People: and</hi> Moab <hi>was diſtreſſed becauſe of the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and</hi> Moab <hi>ſaid unto the Elders of</hi> Midian, <hi>now ſhall this company lick up all that are round about us, as the Ox licketh up the

And if they were ſo little able to reſiſt them then, what ſhall we think after ſo many ſeveral ſucceeding generations, when the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber more Formidable, for ſtrength more United, and when the Government was ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled upon a certain, and as it then appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, an Hereditary foundation, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom being eſtabliſhed in the line and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Saul?</hi> Or how could that be thought ſo great an acceſſion to the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> power and Kingdom; as that it ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve

Secondly, When it is ſaid of <hi>Saul</hi> that he ſhould be higher then <hi>Agag,</hi> there is no queſtion, as I have ſaid, a manifeſt alluſion here made to the Tall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Comelineſs of the perſon of <hi>Saul,</hi> and therefore if this <hi>Agag</hi> who lived in his time, were only pointed at, it would have required ſuch another deſcription of his perſon alſo, that ſo the completion of this Prophecy might the more clearly and manifeſtly appear, for to ſay, that <hi>Saul</hi> ſhould be higher then a Dwarf, or then a perſon of ordinary Stature, was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly no ſuch magnificent repreſentation of his perſon, as to deſerve a Prophecy at ſo great a diſtance of time, to be beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon it, but now <hi>Agag</hi> is no where de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed after this manner, (though I deny not but being King, if the Kingdom of <hi>Moab</hi> were <hi>Elective,</hi> he might probably be Taller then the uſual ſort of People, for the reaſon already mentioned, and perhaps for this reaſon, for the Comelineſs of his Perſon, and the Majeſty of his Character, he was ſpared by <hi>Saul</hi> when the reſt of the

<pb facs="tcp:40306:33" rendition="simple:additions"/> Heaven were accompanied with Chaſmes and Ruptures of the Earth, Gen. 7. 11. <hi>In the ſix hundreth year of</hi> Noah's <hi>life, in the ſecond month, the ſeventh day of the month, the ſame day were all the fountains of the great Deep broken up, and the windows of Heaven were opened.</hi> For the Story of the <hi>ring</hi> it is all of it Fabulous, but yet ſo, as the very Fable it ſelfe diſcovers the truth, and ſhows the Story to have travelled into <hi>Greece</hi> from the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> for it proceeded only from a different underſtanding of the ſame word, which two differences were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards put together and jumbled into the ſame Story, for <hi>tabah</hi> ſignifies to be <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſt</hi> or drown'd in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and the ſame word with the addition only of an <hi>he,</hi> which can hardly be diſtinguiſhed in pronunciation ſignifies, a <hi>ring,</hi> and by this means it happened that the Floud, and the Ring came both into the ſame Story, but for the inprovements that are built upon this foundation, I am not bound to give an account of them, for the progreſs of Fables, and oftentimes their riſe too, is owing to nothing but impudence on the one hand, and credulity on the other.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>brazen horſe</hi> which this Citation ſpeaks of, it is no other then the <hi>Ark</hi> of <hi>Noah;</hi> and whoever it was that brought
<pb facs="tcp:40306:34" rendition="simple:additions"/> this Story into <hi>Greece,</hi> made <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> or <hi>Ogyges</hi> to be the ſame perſon, as it is indifferent to me whether they be or no, only this in the general I contend for, that the Floud of <hi>Noah</hi> and the Deluge of <hi>Ogy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> are the ſame; but now to make this out, that the <hi>brazen Horſe</hi> in this Fable, is the ſame with <hi>Noah's</hi> Ark in the reality, and truth of the Hiſtory it ſelf, it is to be conſidered what he ſays of the <hi>brazen Horſe,</hi> that it had <hi>fores in lateribus, doores in the ſides,</hi> for thus the <hi>Ark</hi> it ſelf is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 16. where God gives in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to <hi>Noah</hi> concerning the faſhion of it—<hi>A window ſhalt thou make to the Ark, and in a cubit ſhalt thou finiſh it above, and the door of the Ark ſhalt thou ſet in the ſide thereof, with lower, ſecond, and third ſtories ſhalt thou make it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, When it is ſaid, <hi>quibus apertis vidit corpus magnitidine inuſitatâ,</hi> that, <hi>opening the doors of this houſe, he ſaw in it the body of a man of an extraordinary bulk,</hi> this is alſo literally true if you do but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, and turn it the other way, not that opening the doors of this <hi>horſe</hi> he ſaw the body <hi>within,</hi> but that opening the door or window of the <hi>Ark,</hi> he ſaw the ſame <hi>without</hi> it, as <hi>Noah</hi> certainly, did when the waters were dried up, ſee many
<pb facs="tcp:40306:34" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſuch bodies of <hi>Gigantick</hi> ſtature, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſize and proportion of thoſe times, lying upon the Ground, and the very mention of this <hi>corpus magnitudine inuſitatâ,</hi> ſhews this Deluge to have been very Ancient, when the ſize of men was much greater, then any the <hi>Greek</hi> Hiſtories, if they will ſpeak truth, can give us an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of, as found among themſelves.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, The reaſon why this corrupt and interpolated ſtory calls the <hi>Ark</hi> a <hi>bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen horſe,</hi> is this, in <hi>Hebrew Tſi</hi> ſignifies a <hi>Ship,</hi> and <hi>ſous</hi> perhaps alſo <hi>ſis,</hi> for <hi>jod</hi> and <hi>vau,</hi> in <hi>Chalday</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> at leaſt, which is no great difference, are actually exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into one another, ſignifies an <hi>horſe,</hi> and <hi>ſis</hi> at this day among the <hi>Turks,</hi> is the word for a <hi>Groom,</hi> or one that <hi>looks af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter horſes,</hi> to which if we add the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of that Wood, of which the Ark was built, the whole myſtery will quickly be explain'd, it was <hi>hatſei gopher, gopher wood,</hi> that is, <hi>Wood daub'd over and covered with pitch,</hi> as all Ships uſe to be; the whole verſe in <hi>Hebrew</hi> runs thus, <hi>hatſei gopher tahaſeh otſoh, vecapharta otſah mibaith onmichouts bacopher,</hi> where <hi>gopher,</hi> and <hi>copher</hi> are without quſtion the ſame, as appears by the word, <hi>gaphrith</hi> which hath the ſignification of <hi>copher,</hi> and is as much

            </p>
            <p>And by this diſcription of <hi>Prometheus</hi> (which I confeſs ſuppoſes the Eternity of this Univerſe, as it is now ordered and framed, at leaſt à <hi>parte poſt,</hi> but that is not to the purpoſe) we ſee what notion the Ancients had of Eternity, namely that it was not a <hi>ſtanding</hi> or <hi>quieſcent,</hi> but a <hi>ſucceſſive</hi> duration, notwithſtanding that our <hi>Schoolmen</hi> will not hear of any ſuch thing, and as they thought of duration that it was ſucceſſive, ſo of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they had always an opinion that he was an extended ſubſtance, till <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and other <hi>Scholaſticks</hi> began by ſubtleties while they pretended, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps really deſigned to aſſert and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Divine exiſtence, to rob him of his Divine Amplitude and Omnipreſent extention, and by ſubtleties diſpute him into nothing.</p>

            <p>I will not deny that I have a ſhrew'd ſuſpition, that it was the opinion of the ancient World as farr as from the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Idolatry, (when men began to worſhip the <hi>hoſt of Heaven)</hi> which is very ancient, that all vitality and life, nay, ſo much as thought and ſpeculation them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, were owing to the heat and influence of the Sun, and that this was their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when they talked of <hi>Prometheus</hi> his <hi>ſtealing fire from Heaven,</hi> which was that <hi>divinae aurae particula,</hi> or in the Language of the Scripture that <hi>Niſhmath chajim,</hi> that <hi>breath of life,</hi> by which the firſt Mortals
<pb facs="tcp:40306:39" rendition="simple:additions"/> were inſpired, and which hath been ſince propagated by generation, and in this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion they were confirmed by a tradition which they had, which was afterwards tranſmitted in writing to poſterity by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> that God made the World in <hi>ſix days,</hi> which they ſo interpreted, by diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>day</hi> and <hi>night</hi> from one another, as indeed <hi>hereb</hi> does properly ſignifie that time, when things are <hi>mixt</hi> and <hi>confounded,</hi> and cannot be <hi>diſtinguiſht</hi> from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo that it is impoſſible to work any longer, I ſay, they ſo interpreted theſe <hi>ſix days work,</hi> as if in the <hi>night</hi> the <hi>Opificer</hi> had <hi>reſted</hi> (as he did afterwards upon the ſeventh day) which was always thought to be the <hi>Suns</hi> method, to work in the day and to repoſe and cool himſelf in his Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern bed at night, until at length the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipodes</hi> were diſcovered, and that opinion vaniſht, together with the errour by which it was occaſioned, not that they looked upon all things to have come by chance as the <hi>Democriticks</hi> and <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans</hi> afterwards did, for this in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was but a modern error, but they had a notion of the <hi>Sun</hi> and the <hi>Stars,</hi> that they were <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>underſtanding</hi> beings, and that they did not only ſee all things that happened upon Earth, but that they

<pb facs="tcp:40306:55" rendition="simple:additions"/> that by the continual poaching and ſoaking of the Water into the Earth, their Roots would be ſo looſened, as that then their own weight, or preponderancy one way more than the other, may be thought ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to overturn them and throw them down; But to this it may be Anſwered, ſuppoſing ſo violent a Wind to be added to this cauſe, that the Roots of a Tree may be very much looſened and weakened, before this effect will follow; that in ſuch tall and maſſy Trees they uſually deſcend deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than any Rain Water can reach, ſo as to poach or looſen the Earth to any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable degree; that it is not unreaſonable to believe that the Earth at ſome conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable depth, might be rather hardened and rendred more cloſe and firm by the weight of the incumbent Waters, than any way ſok'd or looſened by it, as freſh Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is ſometimes found at the bottom of the Sea, the reaſon of which, our ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Mr. <hi>Hook</hi> in his <hi>Micrography</hi> imputes to this, that by reaſon of the great weight of the ſuperincumbent Water, the <hi>Salt</hi> particles are ſqueezed upwards, and the pure <hi>aqueous</hi> parts are brought ſo cloſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that they cannot receive or imbibe into themſelves the <hi>Saline</hi> any longer, and if this be the caſe of Water it ſelf, a thing
<pb facs="tcp:40306:55" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſo fluid and ſo porous as that is, it muſt be much, more true of the Earth, which by reaſon of its comparative ſolidity is more ſuſceptible of ſuch a preſſure, than any Water can be, and in experience it appears, that places which are known to have been recovered out of the Water, ſuch as a great part of <hi>Holland</hi> and the Fenny parts of <hi>England</hi> are, are uſually plain and flat, becauſe of this preſſure of the Water, which was once equal and of long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance over the whole ſurface, and this made Antiquity believe that <hi>Aegypt</hi> it ſelf, as large a Tract of Ground as it is, was once recovered out of the Water, or at leaſt was forſaken by it, becauſe of its flat and equal Soil: not that I believe the force of any Floud to be ſuch, as that it ſhall turn a Mountainous Country into a plain, but it is ſufficient in general to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve from what hath been ſaid, that in ſo great a preſſure of Waters, the Earth at leaſt at ſome conſiderable depth, would rather be hardened, than any way looſned by it, and perhaps. in ſuch prodigious ſhowers as thoſe were, by which the univerſal Deluge was occaſioned, deſcending with a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence ſo great and ſo equal together, it might ſo compreſs and harden the Earth in ſome places, where no ſubterraneous
<pb facs="tcp:40306:56" rendition="simple:additions"/> Ebullitions met with the Rain that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from above, which they neither did nor could do equally in all places, that the Waters might not perhaps penetrate ſo farr, as in ſhowers that are more gentle, if they be but conſtant and of long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance.</p>
            <p>To all which it is to be added, that it is certain that <hi>Noah</hi> pitched his firſt Tent there where the Ark it ſelf reſted, and where he came out of it, when the Waters were aſſwaged, and this was upon the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of <hi>Ararat,</hi> upon the top of which the Waters could not have any thing near ſo much force, as in the Plains underneath, where there was a ſo much greater weight of ſuperincumbent Waters, beſides that it was ſo much the longer before theſe places were overflown, and in proportion to their height they were ſo much the ſooner dry, than other places, neither could the Waters fall with ſo great force upon them, as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the plain and level Country, becauſe their journy of deſcent is comparatively ſo ſmall, which the longer it is, ſo much the greater is the weight of the deſcending body, ſo that if what I have offered above, concerning the Waters hardening rather than ſoftening the Earth, may be admitted, it will hold alſo here though in a leſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
<pb facs="tcp:40306:56" rendition="simple:additions"/> and if it will not, as I think there is no reaſon why it ſhould be rejected, then whatever force there was in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters on the Level for the deſtruction and overthrow of all Trees, or other obſtacles that they met with in their way, was for the reaſons juſt now mentioned infinitely leſs upon the tops of Mountains, beſides that when it ſaid Gen. 8. 1. <hi>That God made a Wind to paſs upon the Earth and the Waters aſſwaged,</hi> this Wind, as it muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by its determination one way, to have deſtroyed the equality of the lateral preſſure of the Waters, and as ſuch to have been a natural cauſe of overturning every thing that came in its way, ſo it had proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly but little force upon the tops of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, the Wind it ſelf being occaſioned by thoſe Watery exhalations, which were firſt exhaled from the top of the watry ſurface, and by conſequence made the depth leſs to the Fathom of the Mountains themſelves, and left that Wind leſs force to act upon them, for the Floud never roſe higher than Fifteen Cubits above the tops of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Mountains, and it is probable did not continue long at that high Water mark, ſo that that which was a prodigious Deluge, in reſpect of the whole Earth, was little more than an ordinary Floud in reſpect of
<pb facs="tcp:40306:57" rendition="simple:additions"/> the higheſt Mountains, and particularly thoſe of <hi>Ararat</hi> upon which the Ark reſted almoſt Three Months before the tops of the other Mountains were ſeen, and almoſt Five Months before the Ground was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dry, and that <hi>Noah</hi> did firſt pitch his Tent upon a Mountain, and particularly upon that of <hi>Ararat,</hi> is plain from this, not only that the Ancient <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and firſt Mortals were uſed to Inhabit upon ſuch Mountainous places, for the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of Divine Worſhip, becauſe in theſe they uſed to offer their Sacrifice and to pay their Devotions, but alſo becauſe till Men began to cohabit in larger communities, theſe were the places, of greateſt ſecurity from the wild Beaſts and from one another, and of the fartheſt proſpect to diſcover an approaching danger, but after the Floud, there were theſe Two particular reaſons why <hi>Noah</hi> ſhould chuſe ſuch a place for his firſt Habitation, Firſt, Becauſe it was moſt wholeſome, conſidering the Damps which the Earth had contracted by ſo long an inundation: and Secondly, Becauſe, otherwiſe we muſt ſuppoſe <hi>Noah</hi> not to have ſtirred out of his Ark for Two Months and an half after ſhe ſtruck upon the Land, and by conſeqence to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred his thank offering for ſo long a ſpace

And this is a new confirmation that the Floud of <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Ogyges</hi> were the ſame, being brought upon the World for the very ſame cauſe and reaſon and not only ſo, but this is alſo a new and clear indication, that this Floud being confined by the <hi>Greeks</hi> to the Province of <hi>Attica,</hi> we are to underſtand by this, as I have ſaid, no more but that it happened among the <hi>Hathikim,</hi> the <hi>Ancient</hi> Inhabitants and People of the World, from whence

But I am very much miſtaken, or nothing of all this is a true account of the matter, but if we would explain it, as it ought to be explained we muſt ſeek for its meaning in the Sacred ſtory.</p>
            <p>The true account of ancient this Story is this, <hi>Cecrops</hi> was the <hi>firſt Man,</hi> and his being made up, after a <hi>Monſtrous</hi> manner, as the Fabulous antiquity hath repreſented him, of the parts of a <hi>Man</hi> and a <hi>Serpent</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40306:83" rendition="simple:additions"/> or <hi>Dragon</hi> put together, was to ſignifie the Two Natures in Man, the one of which is the <hi>rational</hi> or <hi>intellectual,</hi> the other the <hi>animal, ſerpentine</hi> or <hi>ſenſual,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to Luſts and Paſſions and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are therefore compared to a <hi>Serpent,</hi> becauſe of their winding and inſinuating-Nature; or elſe the <hi>Man</hi> and the <hi>Serpent,</hi> are to ſignifie the <hi>Two</hi> ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtates and conditions of Life in which our Firſt Parent was ſucceſſively engaged. The Firſt is the State of <hi>Innocence</hi> and <hi>ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity,</hi> the purely humane and intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al State, undefiled and uncorrupted by any Indiſcretion, Luſt, or Paſſion, being at a perfect Friendſhip with, and having a perfect Dominion and Maſtery of it ſelf, and injoying a free and happy intercourſe with that ſelf-originated Mind and Will, which comprehends within it ſelf the whole Extent and Latitude of truth, and is the Eternal and Immutable Standard, of all kind of <hi>Moral</hi> rectitude and virtue. The Second, or the <hi>Serpentine</hi> Eſtate, is the State of <hi>Degeneracy</hi> from that happy condition, by the Temptations of the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> that is, by the ſuggeſtions of the <hi>lower Life,</hi> which did more eaſily inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate themſelves by the Miniſtry of a Woman, whom the <hi>Devil</hi> made uſe of
<pb facs="tcp:40306:84" rendition="simple:additions"/> upon this occaſion, as being by reaſon of the weakneſs of her Sex, the fitteſt to be firſt Tampered with and wrought upon her ſelf, and afterwards the fitteſt Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to convey the Poyſon of her own deluſions into the mind of her Husband, and theſe, whether ſuggeſtions of the <hi>lower</hi> and <hi>ſenſual</hi> Life in our ſelves, or tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Devil</hi> from without, are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, as I have ſaid, in the <hi>Ancient</hi> Story, which I take it for granted in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelf, is partly Hieroglyphical, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the type and ſhadow of a <hi>Serpent,</hi> becauſe of their winding and inſinuating Nature.—</p>
            <p>And both of theſe Interpretations agree excellently well, with that particular deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription which the <hi>Ancients</hi> have left us of their <hi>Cecrops,</hi> in whom they place the <hi>Humane</hi> Nature <hi>uppermoſt,</hi> and the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine beneath,</hi> for in the Firſt of my Interpretations the Humane or Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Life or Nature, is uppermoſt not only in <hi>dignity</hi> but in <hi>place</hi> too, with reſpect to the ſenſual or concupiſcible, which keeps its reſidence and performs its operations below, beſides that the rational Nature was intended to be the guide and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor of the other, and is therefore by the <hi>Greeks</hi> called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               </gap>, to keep it
<pb facs="tcp:40306:84" rendition="simple:additions"/> within its due bounds and meaſures: and in the other Interpretation, there is as exact an agreement of the Fable to the truth, as in this, for the State of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency was in order of time, before that of degeneracy and declenſion from it. And thus <hi>Cecrops</hi> is deſcribed by <hi>Nonnus, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onyſ. l.</hi> 41.

            <p>Now the true explication of this Fable in <hi>Apollodorus,</hi> that <hi>Vulcan</hi> or <hi>Prometheus</hi> cleft the Head of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> to make a more eaſie paſſage for the Birth of <hi>Pallas,</hi> is this, <hi>Jupiter</hi> in this caſe is the whole <hi>Aether,</hi> whoſe <hi>Head</hi> is the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> whoſe <hi>Rayes</hi> are here compared to <hi>Axes</hi> or <hi>Hatchets,</hi> by which the <hi>Aether</hi> is pierced and cleft, as to our outward ſenſe it ſeems to be; and that from this cleaving, <hi>Pallas</hi> was born, the meaning is no other than this, that the <hi>Sun</hi> or the <hi>Rayes</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> do at leaſt enliven and invigorate, if not create and cauſe that agility and motion, which is to be found in <hi>Pallas</hi> or <hi>Jupiter;</hi> or the wide, ſpacious <hi>Aether,</hi> whoſe Parts all about, though they are of a finer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence and more agil Nature, than thoſe of which this Earth and its <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> is compoſed, yet they themſelves, as they are nearer to the <hi>Sun,</hi> or at a farther di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from it, ſo they partake more or leſs of that Influence, that Warmth and Heat, and briskneſs of Activity and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is communicated and impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, as may be ſeen by that part of the <hi>Aether,</hi> which being mingled and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed with this <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> which we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit, is in the Winter comparatively ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, to what it is found by Experience to

            <p>Laſtly, This was the reaſon, why, when other of the <hi>Poets</hi> make the firſt Man to have been formed out of the Earth by <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metheus, Heſiod</hi> aſcribes the ſame effect to <hi>Vulcan,</hi> becauſe they are indeed both of them the ſame, the ſame with the <hi>Sun,</hi> and with one another; the words of <hi>Heſiod</hi> in his <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

            <p>But now in the firſt place, This <hi>Etymon</hi> from the <hi>Egyptian</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or the <hi>Hebrew Shir,</hi> by the Addition of an <hi>Aleph,</hi> which I have ſhewn al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to be indifferently added or omitted, in the inſtances of <hi>Aram, Armenia, Aſſyria, Acheron, Orpheus,</hi> and others, had been a much more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable account of <hi>Oſiris</hi> than <hi>Serapis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, It would be a puzling Queſtion, if <hi>Plutarch</hi> had been alive, and a Man ſhould have put it to him, why had he not his Name from <hi>Grief</hi> as well as <hi>Joy?</hi> or indeed rather from the former than the latter. For they mourned for his abſence <hi>ſix Months</hi> together; but this Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity which was called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, was as hath been proved, but of <hi>one days</hi> continuance.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> did not rejoyce for the return of the <hi>Sun,</hi> under the name of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapis,</hi> but <hi>Oſiris,</hi> as is evident from <hi>Macrobius,</hi> who tells us expreſly, that the <hi>Phrygians</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed this Ceremony to <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>imes,</hi> and the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> to <hi>Oſiris;</hi> for ſo having ſaid what was laſt before cited concerning the <hi>Phrygians</hi> well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:40306:151"/> their <hi>Attines,</hi> by which Name they call the <hi>Sun;</hi> after a <hi>ſix Months</hi> Period of Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he adds, <hi>Idem ſub diverſis nominibus Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis effectus eſt apud</hi> Aegyptios <hi>cum</hi> Iſis Oſirin <hi>lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get;</hi> where, what he ſays, <hi>ſub diverſis nominibus,</hi> is not ſo to be underſtood, as if the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> in the performance of this Religious Cuſtom, were uſed to invoke the <hi>Sun</hi> by <hi>divers</hi> Names, who in the Celebration of this <hi>Myſtery</hi> was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver called by any other Name than <hi>Oſiris,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the <hi>Satyriſt.</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Exclamare libet populus quod clamat</hi> Oſiri <hi>Invento.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But only that whereas, the <hi>Phrygians</hi> welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>returning Sun</hi> under the name of <hi>Attines,</hi> and the <hi>Earth</hi> was repreſented as mourning for his abſence, under the Name of <hi>Mater Deûm;</hi> the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> meaning the <hi>ſame thing,</hi> and uſing the <hi>ſame Ceremony,</hi> and at the ſame time that the <hi>Phrygians</hi> did, yet had different Names for the Objects of their Devotion, calling the Earth <hi>Iſis,</hi> and the Sun <hi>Oſiris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, The true and unqueſtionable <hi>Etymology</hi> of <hi>Serapis,</hi> is from the <hi>Hebrew Saraph,</hi> ſignifying to <hi>burn,</hi> in which all the <hi>Radicals</hi> of this Name <hi>Serapis,</hi> are evidently contained, and the <hi>ſcortch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heat</hi> and <hi>fiery Nature</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> is alſo very aptly expreſt and ſignified by it, and from hence the <hi>Seraphim</hi> had their Names, being not <hi>Aerial Demons,</hi> but an Order of <hi>Spirits,</hi> whoſe Vehicles were of an <hi>Aetherial</hi> Conſiſtence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of <hi>igneous</hi> or <hi>lucid</hi> Parts, as the <hi>Cherub</hi> at the Entrance of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> is deſcribed, holding a <hi>Flaming Sword</hi> in his hand; and according to what the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith of God in a very known
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:40306:151"/> place, That <hi>he maketh his Angels Spirits, and his Miniſters a Flame of Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Another inſtance which I ſhall give of <hi>Plut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs</hi> unskilfulneſs in theſe Matters, ſhall be taken from what he ſaith concerning <hi>Oſiris;</hi> of which he gives two ſeveral Interpretations, Firſt, That it is as much as <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               </gap>, <hi>an active and beneficent Power;</hi> and in another place, it is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
